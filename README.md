#### Project Description 
##### We will be creating a database that allows users to rate restaurants and their delivery drivers.


&emsp;  To fully understand our database project, itâ€™s important that we first understand the scope and initial elements of the database. The database is designed for a food delivery app. It contains a variety of tables within, ranging from faculty, locations, drivers and vehicles. This is a good database to start with, but its missing a lot of features that could improve it and make it better. We plan to add these features to fix and improve the database. One of which is a rating system to attach to drivers. This would allow the user to know which drivers are good and which drivers are bad. In addition, this added feature will pair nicely with the already existing component within the order table. In the order table, driver_ids are connected as foreign keys that are useful in identifying which drivers are causing trouble on the road.

&emsp;  To implement a rating system, it will be done by adding four attributes to a new table. The attributes are order_id, rating_id, driver_rating, and restaurant_id. Rating_id is the primary key that holds an INT and it is a auto-incrementing starting from 1. Driver_rating is a attribute that holds an int and is determined by the ratings that the driver has earned. Order_id is a foreign attribute from the order table used to identify what order that driver is currently on. Restaurant_id is a foreign attribute that coresponds to the restaurant being delivered from.

## Business Rules:

- A User can rate a driver
- A User can select a driver based off of their ratings
- A User can see how many times their driver was rated
- Drivers can view their ratings
- Administrators can view Driver Ratings
- All drivers are students however not all students are drivers
